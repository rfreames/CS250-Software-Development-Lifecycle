•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To begin interpreting user needs, I would start by interviewing the client and getting an understanding of what they want their project to do. Once there is a base understanding of the project, I could break down their requests into actionable items, or “user stories.” These stories allow developers to create code to meet the specific requirement, and can later be combined to form the project as a whole.

•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Generally, I approach developing programs by starting with a list of requirements, coding small sections of the project, testing, then incorporating another set of requirements until the project is complete. Moving forward, I would like to continue this trend by following the agile principle of developing working software frequently (ex. in sprints focusing on only a handful of features at a time, rather than the entire project at once). I would also like to be part of a team in which communication is consistent throughout the project, with frequent collaboration within the team to accomplish specific tasks. This is another focus of agile, particularly being the focus on face-to-face communication.

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Beyond the technical skills required to be in software development, I believe being a good team member means communicating with the team throughout the process, informing them of my progress, and collaborating with other team members as necessary to accomplish goals. Avoiding working “in a bubble” is essential because very few projects are going to be accomplished by just one person and keeping everyone on the same page helps successfully complete work. Additionally, being able to adapt to change is essential to being a good team member as more teams are using agile which allows changing requirements, but these teams are often on deadlines to deliver software to the client.
